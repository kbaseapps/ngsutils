            The read library (Single or Paired end) to analyze

description : |
    <p> This App computes simple read library summary statistics (for both Paired End and Single End libraries)
    using the <a href="http://ngsutils.org/modules/fastqutils/stats">fastqutils stats</a> command of the
    <a href="http://ngsutils.org">NGSUtils</a> package developed by the Liu Lab at the Indiana University School
    of Medicine</p>

    <p> Statistics are displayed in a KBase Narrative as a simple text Report</a>

    <p> Summary information includes the distributions of read lengths, average quality by base position,
    if the file is in colorspace, and what encoding is used for quality values (Sanger or Illumina). </p>
